  - Ability to duplicate a replica  
  - Editing a replica means creating a new sample based on that replica  
- **Sample location**  
- **Sample identification** must include:  
  - “sample x, sample name, responsible person, origin, isolation date,  
    geographic coordinates, medium used for subculture, location”  
- **Subculture reminder**
  - Choose how many days before it needs to be subcultured again  
- **Sample conditions** (e.g., temperature, photoperiod, bad, good) as **tags**  
  - Used later for filtering  
- **Editable data display** — choose which fields to show
